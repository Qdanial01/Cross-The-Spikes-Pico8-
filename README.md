## 🚀 About

In this game, you explore a small map, and interact with objects
The game teaches me about the implementation of core game mechanics like

- 🧱 Tile-based world building using `_map()` and camera
- 🧍 Player movement and smooth screen scrolling
- 🎮 Collision detection with map flags (`fget`) for solid walls
- 🎵 Sound effects for interactions and ambient feedback
- 💬 Basic in-game text panels and item collection (optional bonus features)
